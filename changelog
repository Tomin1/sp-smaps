sp-smaps (0.3.0) - 2011-02-07

  * New post processing tool `sp_smaps_sorted_totals', that shows sorted
    totals of given mapping for all proecsses.
  * Several tweaks to `sp_smaps_analyze' HTML output:
    * Add tooltips for the columns in the Object Values table. The private
      clean, private dirty and PSS columns are based on summation, while the
      other columns show the maximum values.
    * Tables are now sorted according to the PSS columns. The 'Application
      Values' and 'Object Values' tables can be dynamically sorted by any
      column.
    * Report private and shared separately for clean memory.
    * The "Application XREF" and "Mapping XREF" tables can have hundreds of
      rows, so the table headers are repeated for improved readability.
    * Minimal table of contents added to top of main HTML.

sp-smaps (0.2.4) - 2010-09-06

  * Remove nested functions in sp_smaps_filter.c, fixes executable stack and
    some crashes seen when running under ARM qemu.
  * Fix crash when trying to process non-existent input files.

sp-smaps (0.2.3) - 2010-09-01

  * Add manual pages for all binaries in the sp-smaps-visualize package.
    Fixes: NB#187454

sp-smaps (0.2.2) - 2009-08-20

  * Added support of the new smaps fields - pss, swap, referenced. Fixes: NB#124861

sp-smaps (0.2.1) - 2009-06-26

  * Ignore & give a warning for smaps entries that do not match "==>
    /proc/[0-9]+/smaps <==", instead of dying in assert. This fixes
    cases where we have "==> /proc/self/smaps <==". Fixes: NB#124672
  * Dont try to remove threads from old style capture files.

sp-smaps (0.2.0) - 2009-05-11

  * Switch to sp_smaps_filter written in C. Fixes: NB#103757

sp-smaps (0.1.8) - 2008-07-28

  * Fixed incorrectly named reference to another manual page in
    sp_smaps_filter and a spelling issue in sp_smaps_analyze
    documentation. Fixes: NB#86493

sp-smaps (0.1.7) - 2008-06-18

  * Removed an obsolete script from the package.
  * sp_smaps_snapshot manual page cleanup.

sp-smaps (0.1.6) - 2008-06-03

  * Running sp_smaps_snapshot as a root from serial console caused a
    reboot due to automatic usage of realtime scheduling and elevated
    priority.  This behavior is now optional (-r switch) rather than
    default. Fixes: NB#86016

sp-smaps (0.1.5) - 2007-11-07

  * sp_smaps_analyze.py: Licencing information inconsistencies fixed.
    Fixes: NB#73435
  * sp_smaps_snapshot.c: Avoid calling basename with /proc/PID/cmdline
    strings that might confuse it - Fixes: NB#73438

sp-smaps (0.1.4) - 2007-08-29

  * Not all changed files were commited while making the previous
    release. Fixing that now. Fixes: NB#59897

sp-smaps (0.1.3) - 2007-08-29

  * Checked/fixed licensing information and documentation - Fixes: NB#59897

sp-smaps (0.1.2) - 2007-01-18

  * new postprocessor sp_smaps_filter
  * old python filters retained for compatibility

sp-smaps (0.1.1) - 2006-04-10

  * Code cleanup & help fixes
  * Source package name change to reflect actual contents

sp-smaps-visualize (0.1.0) - 2006-04-07
  * The sp_smaps_snapshot tool now interleaves smaps data with data from
    /proc/pid/status and /proc/pid/cmdline. This allows better handling
    of launchers and multimode binaries like busybox.
  * Use of 'head /proc/[1-9]*/smaps > foo.cap' discouraged as it misses
    the extra information provided by sp_smaps_snapshot. The format is
    still tolerated for handling old capture files.
  * New versions of smaps kernels use [heap] and [stack] type filenames
    for smaps output. These are utilized to obtain more fine grained
    type information.
  * The postprocessing scripts are now implemented as one multimode
    python script. This allows users to skip normalization step as
    all analysis tools can grok raw smaps data.
  * The sp_smaps_analyze now writes out also process hierarchy tree to
    make it easier to find processes of interest. Duplicate label rows
    added to long application and library listings.
  * New tool sp_smaps_appvals can be used to obtain essential memory
    figures from all applications in a capture file.
  * The sp_smaps_diff tool can output either csv or html format.

sp-smaps-visualize (0.0.6) - 2006-02-28

  * merged earlier COW changes by Ville Medeiros

sp-smaps-visualize (0.0.5) - 2005-09-12

sp-smaps-visualize (0.0.4) - 2005-09-12

  * sp_smaps_diff: shows differences between normalized smaps snapshots

sp-smaps-visualize (0.0.3) - 2005-09-09

  * sp_smaps_snapshot now implemented in C

sp-smaps-visualize (0.0.2) - 2005-07-07
